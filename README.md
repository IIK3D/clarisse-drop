# clarisse-drop

Clarisse iFX - "preset" saver - manager with MongoDB as backend, Python 2.7, MongoDB
Clarisse Drop is under heavy development. It was born from my need to reuse stuff I exprimented and made in Clarisse for a faster workflow. I do spend my spare time on this and would appreciate if anyone is interested joining the effort to refine it to its full potential.

This is in no way a final version, the code is dirty, but working, and plan on improving on it. If you have suggestions or requests, please open an issue so we can go over it and try to work it out.

My time is limited so i can provide a limited support since the scripts are realy simple in its core.

Roadmap:
rework user registration
rework config file and dependent code
a proper GUI, filtering, search
UNIX/OSX support
auto update from github
custom attributes transfer
edit/delete entries from database
Future: replace all mongo with proper API
Future: flat files, json support
Future: backup, restore options from json (or so?)
Future: Expand it to Nuke and Houdini Universe
Those who would like to contribute open and issue and let me know so we can crunch it together, you get a Discord invite for free :)

What this tool is not?
Drop is not an asset managment system/manager. Drop is not FTrack or Shotgun. Drop doesnt store any of your referenced files. Drop is not a storage platform.
