# clarisse-drop

Clarisse iFX - "preset" saver - manager with MongoDB as backend, Python 2.7, MongoDB

Clarisse Drop is under heavy development. It was born from my need to reuse stuff I exprimented and made in Clarisse for a faster workflow. 

I do spend my spare time on this and would appreciate if anyone is interested joining the effort to refine it to its full potential.

This is in no way a final version, the code is dirty, but working, and plan on improving on it. 

If you have suggestions or requests, please open an issue so we can go over it and try to work it out.

My time is limited so i can provide a limited support since the scripts are realy simple in its core.
